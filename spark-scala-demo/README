The application was developed and tested with -
Apache Spark (version 3.3.1)
sbt  (version 1.7.2)
Scala (version 2.12.15)
Java (version 11.0.17)
Ubuntu 20.04

Once the flight-data file is downloaded, we can extract the zip file, enter into the directory and run the following commands =>

--------------
To compile
--------------
Run the following command -
sbt clean compile

------------------
To run test cases
------------------
Run the following command -
sbt test

-------------------
To run the program
-------------------
Run the following command -
sbt run

( Please ignore any java.nio.file.NoSuchFileException at the end of the command. You will see [success] message above
the error message which means the program ran successfully. )

-------------------------
To build the runnable jar
-------------------------
Run the following command -
sbt clean assembly

The jar file will be created under target/scala-2.12 directory as flight-data-assignment-1.0.jar


To run the program from the jar file directory, we must specify the config file as first command line argument.
Here is the sample command -

java -jar flight-data-assignment-1.0.jar application.conf

application.conf contains 3 properties. See src/main/resources/application.conf for reference.
